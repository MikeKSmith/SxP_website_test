The Model-Based Meta-Analysis sub-Special Interest Group (MBMA sub-SIG) of the
Statistics and Pharmacometrics Special Interest group (SxP SIG) held an
"Introduction to MBMA" webinar on January 16th 2021.

### Abstract 

As landscapes for the treatment of many diseases have grown
increasingly competitive and costs to conduct clinical trials have soared, it is
critical to understand the landscape of available treatments, as well as the
probability that a specific compound could compete successfully in this market.

Model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) is a tool for integrating prior knowledge, both
public and proprietary, and for using it to inform discovery and development
decisions. As in traditional meta-analysis, MBMA allows one to more precisely
quantify a treatment effect by incorporating data from multiple studies.
Inclusion of model parameters further enables quantification and explanation of
variability observed across trials by accounting for differences in effect
modifiers, such as treatments, doses, time, population characteristics, etc.
Thus, MBMA is a powerful tool for predicting new, potentially interesting
clinical scenarios through clinical trial simulation. Additionally, applying the
MBMA to perform simulations can improve strategic decision-making by projecting
the likelihood of achieving differentiable efficacy and/or safety.

The webinar will enable you to understand what MBMA is and will present some
examples showing the impact it can have in drug development and other critical
business decisions.
